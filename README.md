# HoloLens-Demo-Project

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a **Mixed Reality** demo using **HoloLens 2** and **Unity**. The project integrates real-time eye-tracking data capture and spatial interactions using **Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)**.

### Key Features:
- **Eye-Tracking Data**: Captures and processes gaze origin, direction, and interaction data.
- **Spatial Anchors**: Uses QR code detection to anchor holograms in the real world.
- **Data Streaming**: Streams eye-tracking data from the HoloLens to a server using MQTT and WebSockets for real-time processing.

### Technologies Used:
- **Unity 3D** with MRTK 3.0
- **Microsoft HoloLens 2**
- **MQTT Protocol** for data streaming
- **WebSocket** for bi-directional communication

### Future Goals:
- Integration into larger systems for industrial applications such as 3D printer monitoring.
- Further development on the server-side for enhanced machine interaction.
